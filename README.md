This project involves refactoring and version controlling JavaScript code by isolating it into functions, eliminating global variables, and using meaningful variable and function names. The process includes creating a Git repository, converting functions to function expressions, and using VSCode for git operations and 
ignoring files with a .gitignore file.

learned about the basics of a .gitignore file and what it does and hoiw it interacts in github. It was the first time this term actually writing functions in vscode. As well as the fist time I had tried using github to keep track of changes and repos.
